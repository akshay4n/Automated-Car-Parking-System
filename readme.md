# Automated Car Parking System
This project proposes an automatic parking system for busy urban areas. This project includes sensor information fusion, position estimation, path planning, and tracking algorithm.

### Problems with the Traditional car parking system -
* We see in many shopping malls, hospitals huge traffic jams in front of the parking.
* It is difficult and time consuming to find out the parking slot which costs extra fuel and wastes time.
* Security is one of the major problems in traditional car parking, resulting in car robberies and many more.
* In manual parking system guards need to be appointed which isn’t cost efficient.

### Key Contributions -
* #### Reducing traffic jam: 
Automated vehicle systems help reduce the traffic by efficiently parking vehicles avoiding inappropriate parking.
* #### Time saving: 
In a manual parking system it is difficult to find out the empty space for parking, which is very much time consuming. Whereas here the data of the parking slots is maintained properly,
* #### Safety: 
Avoids accidents.
* #### Fuel saving: 
As there is no need to search for an empty slot, there will be no wastage of fuel.
* #### Operating cost saving: 
There is reduction in the man-hour required as the system does not require any human interaction for the money transaction

### Main aspects of the project,
* Car-Detection algorithm
* Parking slot Searching Algorithm, Shortest Distance algorithm
* IR Sensor Robot car (Black line following Robot Car)

## Results and Analysis:
This project has been tested by simulations and also hardware implementation. 
The hardware equipments that are being used here include Arduino Uno, Ultrasonic sensors, LED’s, Jumper wires, Servo Motor, Motor Shield, IR sensors, etc. The IR sensors are being used in the automated car robot as a prototype, can be switched later to bluetooth modules or NavIC/GPS modules in real-life scenarios.
