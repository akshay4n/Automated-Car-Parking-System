# Automated Car Parking System
This project proposes an automatic parking system for busy urban areas. This project includes sensor information fusion, position estimation, path planning, and tracking algorithm.

Problems with the Traditional car parking system -
* We see in many shopping malls, hospitals huge traffic jams in front of the parking.
* It is difficult and time consuming to find out the parking slot which costs extra fuel and wastes time.
* Security is one of the major problems in traditional car parking, resulting in car robberies and many more.
* In manual parking system guards need to be appointed which isnâ€™t cost efficient.
Main aspects of the project,
* Car-Detection algorithm
* Parking slot Searching Algorithm, Shortest Distance algorithm
* IR Sensor Robot car (Black line following Robot Car)
